            Drones are being used as powerful educational tools in many countries around the world, especially in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) 1. They are fun and require technical focus, which ignites curiosity in young minds. Drone education supports studentsâ€™ practice of critical thinking, the scientific method, situational problem-solving, and collaborative leadership 1.

            There are different types of drones that work best in schools. The curriculum for drone education is tailored by grade level and begins as early as kindergarten 2. Students of all backgrounds and learning styles can easily approach drones because of the sheer curiosity they ignite in young minds 1. From gaining simple aerodynamic skills to advanced computer programming knowledge, educational drones are extremely adaptable to any learning level
